# Information-Retrieval-using-Vector-Space-Model
Technologies used: Python, NLTK library 
• Implemented a suitable mechanism to identify stop words and use them effectively in each context to complete the  information retrieval through the Vector Space Model using Python, NLP library and data mining concepts.
• Accurately assessed sentiment between two words measured using cosine similarity

The repository contains three .py files where we first remove the stop words from the file, convert the data ito tokens and get the similarity between words using cosine similarity.
